Overview

The Smart Civic Issue Detection & Reporting System is a Python-based application that helps citizens report public infrastructure problems such as potholes, garbage overflow, water leakage, broken streetlights, and unsafe areas. The system uses AI and computer vision to automatically analyze images or videos and identify the type and severity of the issue.

This project aims to improve communication between citizens and local authorities by providing a transparent and automated reporting platform that enables faster response and better decision-making.
